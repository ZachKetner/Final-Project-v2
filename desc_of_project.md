Final Project Description for Zach Ketner and Alex Hayes

Overview:
Creating a site that allows Users after registering/logging in to find/create and join cycling group rides.  The site will allow users to upload a file of the route of the ride they choose to create as well as utilizing a maps API to create a clickable map point of the meet up point to start a ride of that route.  There will also be a calendar on the index page that allows users to click dates if rides are already created on that date as well as a general join a ride page to search all upcoming rides.  Users will provide date about their skill level as well as preferred distance so we can filter rides that would be most appealing to them. Fianlly, users can remove themselves as a user as well as remove rides that they created if they are the user that created the ride to start. We plan to use bootstrap and other CSS to create a highly functional and user appealing site that makes the process enjoyable.

Feature List:
Maps API
File Upload using models
